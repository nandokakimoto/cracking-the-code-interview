# Animal Shelter

An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). Create the data structure to maintain this system and implement operations such as `enqueue`, `dequeueAny`, `dequeueDog`, `dequeueCat`. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
